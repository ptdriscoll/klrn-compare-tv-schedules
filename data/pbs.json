From a cabin in the majestic mountains or a covered bride to an owl in a country barn or an autumnal forest scene, Ross creates a complete work of art in each episode -- many of which feature his trademark \"happy little clouds.\" His soothing tone and words of encouragement inspire those painting along at home, and entrance those just watching to see him create his nature scenes.",

From a cabin in the majestic mountains or a covered bride to an owl in a country barn or an autumnal forest scene, Ross creates a complete work of art in each episode -- many of which feature his trademark \"happy little clouds.\" His soothing tone and words of encouragement inspire those painting along at home, and entrance those just watching to see him create his nature scenes.",

From a cabin in the majestic mountains or a covered bride to an owl in a country barn or an autumnal forest scene, Ross creates a complete work of art in each episode -- many of which feature his trademark \"happy little clouds.\" His soothing tone and words of encouragement inspire those painting along at home, and entrance those just watching to see him create his nature scenes.",
