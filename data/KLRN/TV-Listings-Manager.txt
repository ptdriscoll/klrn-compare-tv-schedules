Changes made here are picked up daily by Gracenote at 4 a.m. each morning. But while these changes will show up on PBS digital schedules within 90 minutes, Gracenote requires 72 hours to populate the changes in other schedules. 

Also, the interface looks like it’s built for quick fixes only. You can only look at 24 hours at a time, and you can’t make edits more than two weeks out. It’s not something you would want to use for bulk changes.
