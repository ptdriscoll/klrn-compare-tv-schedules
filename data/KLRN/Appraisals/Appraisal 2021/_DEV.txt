Strengths
Comment on a major achievement over the last year and/or strength(s) of yours that best contribute to the success of your team. Provide examples & impact.

My strengths include coding skills, data analysis, content strategy, user-experience design, and journalism experience. 

Projects I’ve been part of over the past year include ¡Salud!, Hank & Emma Faye, The Black Church, Future of Work, Muhammad Ali, a new Sponsorship web page, and Camp TV. Each of these projects have a consistently clean and attractive  web page, which I was able to efficiently create thanks to our Bento templates along with some custom-coded modules such as our YouTube video player.   

The biggest project of the year involved migrating assets of an old in-house server to a cloud server. This included configuring a cloud account for a virtual server, and refactoring code from ASP.NET to PHP. This server hosts assets that don’t conveniently fit into our core Bento website, and gives us flexibility to  host some high-impact applications.   

Identify the two most important things KLRN can do that would improve your work environment, your ability to do your job more efficiently and/or effectively and that would help you achieve your career goals and enhance your career development and personal satisfaction or that would help the KLRN better achieve its mission and goals.

I would like to strategically apply my knowledge of A/B testing, predictive analysis and application development. The idea is to target high-impact opportunities that either increase revenues, strengthens our community reach, or automates repetitive tasks. 

Because of technical dependencies, we would want to focus on projects that don’t break our core online presence. For example, while our pledge search-gift application brings in up to $50,000 a year, if for some reason we were not able to run the app during a pledge, online donations would still occur.

Also, we would want to be strategic since my time is limited by everyday tasks and occasional updates. And we would want to target opportunities that do not significantly increase ongoing workloads.
Here are some ideas:

•	Use A/B testing and user feedback to drive continuous improvements to member donation funnels. Previous testing we did indicates we could increase giving by up to $100,000 a year.
•	Leverage data from Allegiance, Passport and Wealth Engine to create donor profiles. We could learn characteristic of who is likely to donate, renew or lapse.
•	Ian Cruz’s idea to hold a citywide SanAntoVision event, loosely modeled on EuroVision, will need an online application backed by a database. Experiments like this could pave the way to generating deep community involvement like we had with Blazing Gavels, and help us cultivate a younger audience.
•	If we are going to use data to inform our decisions, an online dashboard would be a good way to pull together key performance indicators into a convenient location that’s easily accessible.

A hybrid schedule working 2 to 3 days a week in the office and 2 to 3 days remotely. This would provide a good balance to benefit from interactions with coworkers, including serendipities discussions and brainstorming, as well as uninterrupted times to focus on more intensive projects.    

Identify other topics or issues you would like to discuss with your supervisor.

I would like to discuss ways to increase my value to KLRN so that I can earn more. Also, while in past years I have been receiving cost-of-living increases, for the first time I'm concerned that my salary has fallen below my starting pay when adjusted for inflation.
