Instructions: A very important part of the Annual Performance and Career Development Review is your selfappraisal of your performance, progress, and career preferences and plans. This self-appraisal has
been designed to : (1) provide a mechanism for you to conduct a self-evaluation of your
performance and development needs each year; (2) identify areas where you believe that you need
additional experience, counseling, and support (i.e. training, on-the-job coaching, and feedback) in order to
achieve your potential within the Company; and (3) provide a basis for meaningful discussions with
your supervisor on your future goals, as well as your career preferences and interests to facilitate your
career development within the Company.
