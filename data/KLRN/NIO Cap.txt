It's all about understanding peoples stories and connecting them to our value proposition.
Online analytics and data give us additional and continual feedback.
With enough online traffic, A/B testing gives us a way to ask donors questions while minimizing risk.   
The idea is to create a culture of testing and optimization.

KEY POINTS
Value proposition
Document testing results
Instant donation pages 

COMMITMENT
We need a cultural commitment, from top management on down, to grow our digital audience and donations
We should adopt a culture of routinely testing and optimizing
We should be more performance driven, with people having ownership over providing solutions
We need to work more cross-departmental, less siloed

STRATEGY
We need to agree on measurable goals
We should track everything, and use data to understand audiences, personalize messages and optimize results
We should prioritize efforts based on costs and benefits 

PRIME AREAS TO TEST
online advertising such as Facebook
email campaigns
landing pages

REVENUE-DRIVING TATICS
We should promote Passport on a continual basis through Facebook, email camapigns, the website and events
We should continually explore digital pledge campaigns  
We should routinely test campaign messaging, landing pages and donations funnels, especially for daily donations 

TEST EXAMPLES
What is our value proposition
Short text vs. long text
Videos vs. no videos
What should and should not be on a donation form

TO DOS
Need statistical significance
Should prioritize efforts so we don't overwork ourselves
Should document results

CLASSES
Facebook ads
email campaigns
Landing pages
